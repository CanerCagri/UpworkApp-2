I started to make the jobs I saw on Upwork, even if employer didn't return to my proposal.

## Job Milestones:

1. Upload an image
2. When image uploaded, use the image to set as the background color (blurred)
3. Add original image in the middle to fit the screen vertical or horizontal (whatever is longer)
4. Allow to zoom-in/zoom-out by using two fingers
5. Allow to move image (off the screen as well) with one finder or two fingers
6. Show toggle "Show background" when image is NOT fully zoomed it and hide the toggle if image has been zoomed in to occupy the whole screen
7. If "Show background" is ON then use the blurred version of the image in the background, if toggle is "Off" then set background color to Black
8. On button "revert to original", reset the original image in the middle
9. Save as image (background + image) on "save"
